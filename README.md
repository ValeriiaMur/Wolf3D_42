# wolf3D

*Summary: This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90’s game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way.*

This 42 project is about creating a first game - a simple clone of an iconic Wolf3d. This graphics project covers the topics of raycasting, the use of textures, Rigor, use of C, use of basic algorithms, information research, data mining etc. 


You can create any maze for this game using a simple format :

1 1 1

1 0 1

1 1 1

Where numbers bigger than 1 mean walls and 0 means a floor. The map made of all zeroes will automatically have walls around it. 
*The bonuses include:*

1. FPS counter
2. Sprites (a racoon who is hiding in one of the rooms in this game, but it can be literally anything in an XPM format. Loaded in the same func as all the textures.)
2. The use of textures
3. Minimap 
4. Menu
5. 5-second speed boost (press shift)
